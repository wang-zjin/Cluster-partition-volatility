function states = markovSim(dim, transM)         

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Purpose: Simulation of a Markov Chain 
%
% INPUTS:
%   dim: length of the markov chain
%   transM: the transition matrix which have to be a square matrix
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   states: a matrix dim x k. The state of the Markov chain at any time. 
%               The rows represent the periods and the column the states.
%               For exemple, if the process is in state 1 at time t, the
%               cell (t,1) take value equal to 1 and cells (t,2:k) 0.
